Current projects
----------------

### Bio-physical model of an epithelium undergoing morphogenesis

We have developed a simple model of a drosophila
[epithelium](http://en.wikipedia.org/epithelium) that we use to study
the role of apoptosis in tissue folding.

### Tracking moving cell clusters

We provide 3D + time tracking of nuclei to quantify the dynamics of a
migrating cell cluster in the drosophila embryo.

The analyzed images consists in series of [fluorescence
microscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fluorescence_microscopy) image
stacks (from confocal microscopes). The collected trajectories are
subsequently classified according to their phenotypes.

### Mitotic chromosome dynamics

We have developed a toy model of chromosome segregation during
[mitosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitosis) of the [fission
yeast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fission_yeast)

You can find details about this model in [this
publication](http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201107124)
