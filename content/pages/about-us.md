## About Guillaume


![A photo of me]({filename}/images/portrait_gg.jpg "A photo of me where I look thoughtfull")


My name is Guillaume Gay. I am currently working as an independent
researcher and software developer in physical biology and cell
biophysics.

I am a free software user and developer. I mostly use the
[Python](http://www.python.org) programming language, with the
wonderfull [Numpy and friends](http://www.scipy.org) libraries.

I studied physics and chemistry in Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Toulouse,
France. During my PhD, I worked on experiments trying to combine
[laser cooled atoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_cooling "See
what's laser cooling at Wikipedia") and light fields generated by
small apertures in metallic films, called
[surface plasmon polaritons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_plasmon
"Wikipedia is your friend"). I defended my thesis in june 2006, and
shortly after made a small jump to another building of my *alma mater*
university in Toulouse and found myself in a
[cell biology lab](http://www-lbcmcp.ups-tlse.fr/Nouveau_site/modeles/LBCMCP-Accueil.htm
"Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Moléculaire de la
Prolifération"), in [Sylvie Tournier's team](http://s.pombe.free.fr
"S. Tournier home page"). I was hired thanks to my optics know-how, in
order to work on a
[FRAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence_recovery_after_photobleaching
"Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching") and micro-discection
apparatus on a wide field microscope. This left me with some spare
time, so I started working on automated tracking procedures for
microscopy images. This brought me to the fission yeast model
organism, s.Pombe, and the fascinating process of mitosis. It occurred
to me that the data we were gathering gave sufficient information for
modeling purposes, so I started devising a model of chromosome
segregation in fission yeast.

Parallel to this, I worked with V. Lobjois and C. Lorenzo, who are
know part of the [IP3D](http://www.ip3d.fr/IP3D/Accueil.html) team at
ITAV - a cancer research facility. to build a Selective Plane Imaging
Microscope (or SPIM) to study proliferation in 3D cancer cell
cultures. In 2008, I spent a semester at
[Los Andes University](http://www.uniandes.edu.co/) in Bogotá,
Colombia as an invited professor in the
[biophysics group](http://fisica.uniandes.edu.co/index.php/en/research/biophysics),
where I worked on giant unilamellar vesicles sedimentation, taught
basic physics to biology and medecine students, and learned Spanish.
