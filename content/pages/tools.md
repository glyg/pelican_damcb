Making the most out of biological images
----------------------------------------

Since around the turn of this century, the volume and quality of
numerical data have literally [geometrically
grown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_Law) in biology as every where
else.

Yet, passing from raw information to the human readable and convincing
evidence of a biological phenomenon is far from trivial. We try to help
biologists in this task, through automated image analysis and
annotation, mathematical description of dynamic phenotypes and
simulations.

Our approach to this problem can be qualified as **systemic**, as the
quantification and formalization of observed phenotypes is considered an
essential step in *systems biology*
[research](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/366/1584/3635)
. We provide tools to "bridge the gaps" between the various levels of
organization and observation of a biological object, from the single
protein to the phenotype.

Tools of the trade: scientific python
-------------------------------------

Each problem is unique, yet many share common grounds. This simple
observation is at the root of the free software philosophy of open,
reusable, shared software. We adhere entirely to this philosophy.

In practice, this means that once our results are published, the source
code of our analysis becomes public. This has several virtues:

-   The quality of our analysis can be vetted by the community
-   Our collaborators are free to keep using the tools we developed
    together. : We are actually *very* welcoming to contributors!
-   Free software and freedom of information is generally good for every
    body.

We rely on the marvellous [scientific python
ecosystem](http://scipy.org).
