.. admonition:: Welcome

    We are a small company offering *free and open source software*
    services to help biologists get the most out of their experiments.
    Our area of expertise is in the development of tailored **image
    analysis in 3D+t**  and  **data driven modelling** of living
    organisms, from the single cell to the epithelium.

Current projects
================

Bio-physical model of an epithelium undergoing morphogenesis
------------------------------------------------------------

We have developed a simple model of a drosophila
`epithelium <http://en.wikipedia.org/epithelium>`__ that we use to
study the role of apoptosis in tissue folding.

Tracking moving cell clusters
-----------------------------

We provide 3D + time tracking of nuclei to quantify the dynamics of a
migrating cell cluster in the drosophila embryo.

   :alt: Preview of the cell migration project

The analyzed images consists in series of `fluorescence
microscopy <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fluorescence_microscopy>`__
image stacks (from confocal microscopes). The collected trajectories are
subsequently classified according to their phenotypes.

Mitotic chromosome dynamics
---------------------------

We have developed a toy model of chromosome segregation during
`mitosis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mitosis>`__ of the `fission
yeast <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fission_yeast>`__

You can find details about this model in `this
publication <http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201107124>`__

Making the most out of biological images
========================================

Since around the turn of this century, the volume and quality of
numerical data have literally `geometrically
grown <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_Law>`__ in biology as every
where else.

Yet, passing from raw information to the human readable and convincing
evidence of a biological phenomenon is far from trivial. We try to help
biologists in this task, through automated image analysis and
annotation, mathematical description of dynamic phenotypes and
simulations.

Our approach to this problem can be qualified as **systemic**, as the
quantification and formalization of observed phenotypes is considered an
essential step in *systems biology*
`research <http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/366/1584/3635>`__
. We provide tools to "bridge the gaps" between the various levels of
organization and observation of a biological object, from the single
protein to the phenotype.

Tools of the trade: scientific python
=====================================

Each problem is unique, yet many share common grounds. This simple
observation is at the root of the free software philosophy of open,
reusable, shared software. We adhere entirely to this philosophy.

In practice, this means that once our results are published, the source
code of our analysis becomes public. This has several virtues:

-  The quality of our analysis can be vetted by the community

-  Our collaborators are free to keep using the tools we developed
   together. : We are actually *very* welcoming to contributors!

-  Free software and freedom of information is generally good for every
   body.

We rely on the marvellous `scientific python
ecosystem <http://scipy.org>`__.
